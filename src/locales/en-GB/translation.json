      "p1": "From Abyss emerged from a shared vision to connect the global horror community through a decentralized, open platform. Born from the intersection of horror culture, technology, and independent media, we set out to create a space where creators, fans, and critics could engage meaningfully.",
      "p2": "Our journey began with a simple observation: horror as a genre thrives on community, yet existing platforms often silo conversations and limit creative expression. We envisioned a platform that would preserve identity across federated networks while celebrating the craft of horror through art, psychology, and technology.",
      "p3": "Today, From Abyss serves as both a multimedia portal and a social network, featuring in-depth game reviews, analytical essays, multimedia productions, and a federated feed that connects horror enthusiasts worldwide. We document the evolution of horror as a long-term cultural archive, ensuring that the stories, analyses, and conversations that shape the genre are preserved and accessible.",
      "p4": "Built by Tellurian and From Abyss Studio, our platform represents a commitment to open standards, decentralized architecture, and the belief that horror culture deserves a space that respects both its artistic depth and its community-driven nature."
